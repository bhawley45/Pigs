# Pigs?: A Commical 2D Platformer

Embark on an epic adventure in "Pigs," a thrilling 2-level 2D platformer where you play as a valiant young prince tasked with saving your kingdom from a mysterious foe.

## Overview

This project is my second time using Unity for a "full" game project. The game itself is definitely rough around the edges but served as a stepping stone in my game dev journey :)

## Features

- **Thrilling 2D Platforming**: Traverse through the castle's rooms and corridors, each filled with unique challenges and traps.
- **Exquisite Gameplay**: Encounter questionable level design and trap placement that'll make you wonder what the builders were ....
- **Tasteful Art Style**: Enjoy a fun retro-inspired art style with some custom flare!

## Game Engine

This game was developed using Unity 2022.3.13f1

## Art Assets

This project primarily uses assets from the "Kings and Pigs" pack from itch.io. After doing some staging for the levels though I decided to add some custom sprites and animations to help blend the environment. I used GIMP, which I was fairly new to at the time, but the challenge of matching the art style of the original pack was a fun learning experience.

## Game Development

Development was fairly straightforward, including blocking levels, asset design, and implementation, and scripting. However, I had to learn some previously unknown features of Unity to fit my vision for the game, most notably sprite maps, custom UI elements, sound effects, and the Cinemachine state-driven camera system.

## Challenges and Learnings

The hardest challenge encountered was trying to use Unity's Cinemachine camera system, which I was able to improve in subsequent projects. The only other hurdle, as stated earlier, was creating pixel art in a similar style to the original asset pack.

## How to Play

To play "Pigs?," follow these simple steps:

1. Download the latest release from the repository's [Releases](#) page.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Run the executable and dive into the adventure.

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thank you to the creators of the "Kings and Pigs" asset pack, and to the open-source community behind GIMP for making the creation of this game possible.

Enjoy your journey through the heart of the kingdom, and may your adventure be as enlightening as the development was for me.
